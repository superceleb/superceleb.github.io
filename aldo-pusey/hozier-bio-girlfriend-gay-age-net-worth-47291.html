His second studio album,&nbsp;“Wasteland, Baby!”&nbsp;released in March 2019 under British label Island Records, doesn’t stray from his Blues roots.</p><p dir=ltr>His integrity and unwillingness to give in to the musical trends have only widened his fanbase, which meant an increase in album and tour ticket sales.

He states that sex and humanity are tied together, and regardless of any sexual orientation, it is just natural, but the church says that it is doctrine and sinful. However, he also claims that the song is not an attack on faith.</p><p>“The song is about asserting yourself and reclaiming your humanity through an act of love… But it’s not an attack on faith… it’s an assertion of self, reclaiming humanity back for something that is the most natural and worthwhile…”</p><h2><span id=Where_was_Hozier_born_Ethnicity_Nationality_Family>Where was Hozier born?
