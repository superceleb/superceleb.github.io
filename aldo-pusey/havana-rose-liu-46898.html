Her given name is Havana Rose Lui. She is of Asian (Chinese) descent and holds American citizenship.&nbsp;Rose Liu is an ardent Christian. She came into the world into a rich household. David Liu, her father, is the creator and owner of “The Knot Worldwide,” an American media and technology firm. In the early 1990s, he relocated to the United States. There, he met Havana’s mother, Carley Roney, a white American girl, and they married in 1993.</p><p>They were blessed with Havana, our future actress, after four years.

Perhaps her commitment to her job has kept this gorgeous actress free of the constraints of a relationship. However, we cannot be definite about her dating history because she could have covertly dated her loved one.</p><h2><span id=Havana_Rose_Liu-_Professional_Career>Havana Rose Liu- Professional Career</span></h2><p>Havana Rose Liu’s first professional game as a multimedia artist was during her adolescence.
