Since I am a female and have a striking likeness to my father, it is true that my father has four boys in all, all of them are similar to him in some manner. In addition, I feel that I should be given the same opportunity to audition for the role and be given equal consideration based on my acting ability and not just my relation. I believe that my brother should have to audition and earn the role by delivering a great read instead of just being handed it.</p><p>“I have dreamed of getting this role for many years now,” Eazy’s daughter continued.</p><p>But in the end, F. Gary Gray’s film gave Jason Mitchell, who was a relative unknown at the time, the chance to have a fantastic performance. It depicts the highs and lows of the N.W.A. gangsta rap group.</p><p>Erin also gave Mitchell’s acting in the hugely popular film high marks. Says she</p><p>“He performed really well. I’m too happy about it. I have heard these stories all my life. Jason fulfills every expectation I had about [my father]… I had the distinct impression that he was on screen.</p><h2><span id=Wright_Erin_Bria8217s_siblings>Wright, Erin Bria’s siblings</span></h2><p>From her father’s several relationships, Wright has ten and a half siblings, including the rapper and HIV campaigner Lil Eazy-E.
