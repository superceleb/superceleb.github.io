Ethnicity, Nationality, Family, Education</span></h2><p>Ariela Weinberg, the star of “90 Day Fiance,” was born in America to American parents. Her father owned a cardiology practice. Ariela looked up to her mother. In many ways, she inherited her mother’s love of travel. Furthermore, in June 2020, Ariela shared an anecdote involving the two on Instagram. In her own words:</p><p><strong>“I love that the episode featured this photo of my mom and me traveling through Argentina together! The trip of a lifetime. In La Plata, we rented a car and drove north. We went to Paraguay and Brazil before returning to Buenos Aires via other northern provinces.”</strong></p><p>Ariela mentioned her two nephews on Instagram. In conclusion, she grew up with two older sisters named Kristin and Adele. Ariela’s family did not approve of her relationship with Biniyam, as seen in <strong>“90 Day Fiance: The Other Way.”</strong> Furthermore, they suggested that Biniyam was using her to obtain a green card.</p><p>In addition, Ariela was from Princeton, New Jersey. Similarly, she and her family embraced their Jewish heritage. Ariela’s grandparents, Emanuel Weinberg and Fannie Blatstein fled the Russian regime’s persecution in the early nineteenth century. They then relocated to New York.</p><p>She has not revealed her educational background.</p><h2><span id=90_Day_Fiance_Ariela_Weinberg_Biniyam_Shibre_Pregnant_Motherhood_and_Marriage>[90 Day Fiance] Ariela Weinberg & Biniyam Shibre: Pregnant, Motherhood, and Marriage</span></h2><p>During her trip to Ethiopia, Ariela Weinberg met dancer and gymnast Biniyam Shibre. She described their first meeting as follows: “I was waiting for a taxi outside a nearby hotel when I noticed a very attractive man. I yelled, ‘Don’t I know you from somewhere?’ and it worked.”</p><p>Ariela, despite falling for Biniyam’s charms, was not looking for a serious relationship. Against her better judgment, she finally succumbed and began dating the Ethiopian hunk. Ariela became pregnant three months into their relationship as boyfriend and girlfriend. She returned to the United States for prenatal care.</p><p>After that, Ariela and Biniyam agreed to have their child in Ethiopia.
