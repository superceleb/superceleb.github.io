He had to be cheating on his wife, Sheri Easterling, according to internet rumors.</strong></p><p>After the videos went viral, Renée Ash, an Instagram user, shared affectionate pictures of herself and Lopez with the caption, “I’ll tell my side of the story when I’m ready.”</p><p>In an exclusive interview with Page Six, she finally broke her silence and opened up about her relationship with the renowned TikToker’s father.</p><p>According to Ash, she supposedly dated Lopez for five months before breaking things off when she discovered he had been lying to her the entire time and saw the videos. When it wasn’t true, he told her that his marriage to his wife had ended.</p><p>Lopez deceived Ash into thinking they had a special connection by introducing her to his family and telling her he wanted to have children with her.</p><p>I believed we had a genuine connection when he even introduced me to his mother and youngest sibling. Ash added, “He gave me a narrative about his wife that made me think they were separated and seeking a divorce.</p><h2>Monty Lopez describes his marriage to his wife as “weird”</h2><p>Additionally, Ash published screenshots of allegedly exchanged messages and WhatsApp chats by Lopez.</p><p>According to Page Six, the two made plans to live together, get married, and start a family when the latter informed the former that they were a power couple.</p><p>When Ash questioned Lopez about his marriage, he claimed that he and his wife had a “strange connection” and claimed that they hardly ever spoke.</p><p>The father of a well-known TikToker allegedly stated in another text that he “left” his wife because she was “bitching” and “[expletive] with” him.</p><p>He then issued a warning to Ash, saying that if she continued to act in this way, their relationship might end.</p><p>A source claims that the claimed pair almost ended their relationship after a pregnancy scare. Lopez dismissed Ash’s claim that she might be pregnant and informed her that she was not.</p><p>After that, Ash attempted to end things with Lopez, but he kept texting her nonstop, and they reconciled. But she ended things when she found out he had an affair.</p><p>“Neither Addison and Sheri nor the other girls he has disrespected deserve this. Ash told the newspaper, “I believe that sharing my story will throw light on a man who has been allowed to abuse his position of authority in the business for far too long.</p><h2>Sheri Easterling Reacts to the Dramatic Situation</h2><p>Following the publication of Ash’s accusations and her interview with Page Six, Easterling posted a message on her Instagram story about her spouse and the charges.</p><p>“Bringing personal concerns into the public eye is difficult and overwhelming for everyone concerned. I’ll be alright. My children, with their vulnerable hearts and minds, are and always will be my top priority, Easterling wrote.</p><p>She emphasized that she would do her utmost to protect them and that her purpose was to make them feel safe and comfortable.</p><p>She concluded by expressing her gratitude to everyone who sent her love and support.
