The nightmare is done, he added.</strong></p><h2><span id=Is_Nikocado_Avocado_Married_Relationship>Is Nikocado Avocado Married? Relationship</span></h2><p>The four-year marriage of Nicholas Perry, also known as Nikocado Avocado, appears to have come to an end. Nikocado should take care of himself and “start doing things on his own,” Perry’s husband Orlin suggests in the YouTube video “We Broke Up & I Moved Back To Colombia.”</p><p>I understand that many of you will be disappointed since you like to see us together, but it’s just not healthy. Orlin Home, Nikocado’s husband, said that the video that was uploaded on September 14, 2021, has already received over 188K YouTube views.</p><p>The Divorce of Nikocado Avocado’s Husband, Orlin Home Orlin, Nikocado’s partner, said that he initiated the breakup and stated, “I can’t handle it anymore.”</p><p>He went on to say,</p><p>I merely packed my things and headed off. I am at the airport and have decided not to return. Homes continues by saying that the Mukbanger suffered greater loss than he did because he was the one who sobbed the most.</p><p>Home, a YouTuber himself, expressed concern for his ex and his desire for Perry to have a healthy lifestyle and manage his eating habits. He stated: Maybe it will finally dawn on him that he cannot continue to live this way indefinitely since he will practically die from the constant eating he engages in.</p><p>Orlin ultimately put an end to his ten-minute film with a minute of quiet before adding a sentence that said, I’m relieved it’s finished.&nbsp;Nikocado responded to the separation one day earlier, on September 13, 2021, and blamed the crowd for it all.</p><h2><span id=Who_Is_at_Fault>Who Is at Fault?</span></h2><p>It’s no coincidence that his statement, “These Mukbang shows are making my weight spiral out of control and it’s your people’s responsibility,” corresponds to the title of his video, “We Broke Up Because I’m Too Fat.”</p><p>The 29-year-old YouTuber then sat in his chair to record a mukbang video after the clip. He was wearing a t-shirt that read,</p><p>A Medical Mysteries About My Weight</p><p>Nikocado had a slim build and weighed about 160 lbs before starting his YouTube career. However, after starting his eating journey, the YouTuber has acquired more than twice that amount of weight.</p><p>Nikocado continued by saying that for the past two days, he has been waking up at five in the morning.</p><p>Since Orlin is no longer here, I should set up a new schedule.</p><p>Additionally, he admits that he didn’t believe the situation was critical and asked, “Where did Orlin go?” He also says that he was blocked.</p><p>According to the video, Perry didn’t know his husband was returning to Columbia at the time because he assumed Orlin was simply “playing games.”</p><p>Nikocado did not tell much about their relationship or separation, but he did say that they had split up and were not communicating.</p><p>When the 29-year-old finally logged off the video, he expressed his “upset” at Orlin’s absence and stated,</p><p>“I’m assuming he’ll be back tomorrow and that this is some kind of childish prank,” she said.</p><p>In a recent YouTube video titled “I didn’t release this Mukbang with Nick… till now,” Nikocado’s husband encourages her to eat salad and upload outtakes from the video.</p><p>The two used to be inseparable in love, but the relationship appears to have ended lately.</p><h2><span id=A_Trip_Down_Memory_Lane>A Trip Down Memory Lane</span></h2><p>The couple shares their love story with their fans in a YouTube video that was uploaded on May 29, 2016.</p><p>Orlin claimed in the video that they had connected in a Facebook group two to three years before 2016. The name of the Facebook group was “Gay Vegan Men.” Orlin mentioned that Nikocado had asked for suggestions for an alternative shampoo.</p><p>Then Nikocado and his husband began communicating via private messaging, and Nikocado sent his first text to Orlin, who is 29 years old. The pals eventually became boyfriends after spending a lot of time and traveling together. After more than three years of dating and one year of being in a relationship, the couple was married in 2017.</p><p>Fans who are unsure of whether they are truly divorced can only wait and see as this is not the first time their divorce frenzy has occurred. The couple posted videos in June 2020 declaring their intention to divorce but then reconciled. Although none of the ex-pair has made any public statements online, Live RampUp will make sure to keep you informed of any new information concerning their romance.</p><p>Also Read, <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Viggo Sorensen</a>, <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Avivasofia</a>, and <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Giselle Guilmette</a>.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>YouTuber</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Jack Doherty</a></h3>Jack Doherty- Biography Jack Doherty is an American YouTuber and Social Media Personality.
