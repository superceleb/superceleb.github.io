Why Shaved Her Head</h1><div><strong>Publish date: </strong>2024-06-07</div><p><strong>Since 2021, Alexander has been the series’ main character in the HBO Max series Gossip Girl. She had only been in a Facebook Watch series called Sacred Lies: The Singing Bones before beginning her career as a lead, but it garnered a ton of support from the general audience.</strong></p><p>Viewers were aware of her position after she began her adventure in the Gossip Girl series. As a result, while safeguarding individuals, many have been interested in finding out why she chose to remove her hair.</p><h2>How did Jordan Alexander’s Hair fare?</h2><p>Alexander decided to go blade and don a fresh, edgy appearance. She formerly had black hair that was curled.</p><p>However, fans are enjoying her new year; they all praised her appearance. With no hair, she exudes greater boldness and confidence.</p><p>Jordan’s style, appearance, and attitude are her key selling points. As usual, she is moving on the right path.</p><p>Her followers have praised her appearance as usual, and she also likes to remain hairless.</p><h2>Why Did Jordan Alexander, Who Was Cast in Gossip Girl, Shave Her Head?</h2><p>She said that she had difficulty with her hair being curly in the interview and sources that followed. It used to take longer to prepare her hair.</p><p>She so decided to go hairless one day. As shown in her photographs, she frequently wore braids and her hair had a mixture of textures.</p><p>In an interview, Alexander stated that she used to focus more on maintaining her hair than anything else. Her hair was always compiled; creating curly hair requires skill and passion.</p><p>She so decided to shave her hair and not care for it. Alexander said that it was a simple way to stop worrying about her hair during the day, at night, and in the morning.</p><p>She shaved her head mostly out of annoyance that her hair took up so much of her time.</p><p>Also, no one was around to assist her with her hair when she moved out and began living alone. According to her, her sister constantly assisted her in doing her hair.</p><p>She thus did not consider it beforehand and simply did it one day, feeling relieved to be bald. She also said that she couldn’t do it at one time back then.</p><p>She can now leave the house without getting her hair done and still appear very confident. She can unwind when traveling any place with her hair.</p><p>When compared to her older photos, she appears different in the news appearance, and it also complements her.</p><p>While most ladies like having long, thick hair, she did not enjoy her naturally thick, curly, black hair.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read, Chris Santos, Shawn Kemp, and Aabha Bakaya."}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1053569,"3":{"1":0},"10":2,"11":0,"12":0,"15":"Arial","23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":23}{"1":25,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":35}{"1":41,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":53}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/chris-santos/"}{"1":23}{"1":25,"2":"https://popularbio.com/shawn-kemp/"}{"1":35}{"1":41,"2":"https://popularbio.com/aabha-bakaya/"}{"1":53}'>Also Read, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Chris Santos</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Shawn Kemp</a>, and <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Aabha Bakaya</a>.</span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Actress</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Who Are Paula Yates’ Best Friend’s Kids</a></h3>Brewin has divulged all that she knew about Paula Yates in a two-part series that will run on Channel 4 and examine her life and death.
