We must state unequivocally that her historic step will have an indelible influence on her life. Kristen made her AGT debut on June 21, when the fourth round of season 17 auditions aired. Kristen disclosed in an Instagram post from May 30 that she had applied to AGT.</p><p>I auditioned for @agt! I’m overjoyed to tell you! “God is so lovely!” she wrote. Her performance astounded the judges, with Cowell applauding her “unbelievable” audition. Was that you singing, he wondered later? I was surprised because many of the overconfident singers who perform here are bad, so I wasn’t alone. Your voice is “seasoned,” in my opinion. You’re not a rookie like that. Your vocal range and tone are excellent.</p><p>You have wonderful taste, by the way, because the music was a fantastic pick. Mandel went on, “You open your mouth and you’re on fire.” Klum gushed, “I adore everything about you.” You’ve already got the makings of a superstar. You simply have “it,” a true gift. Vergara was among Cruz’s admirers, adding, “The minute you started singing, you became so powerful, so confident.”</p><p>It was both surprising and enticing!” Cruz’s AGT audition appeared on Tuesday’s broadcast, and many people have been applauding it online since then. “This little lady is great!” one fan wrote on Twitter. Her voice is incredible, with hints of Janice Joplin and Adele. She should have gotten the golden buzzer!</p><h2><span id=Social_Media_Details>Social Media Details</span></h2><p>Kristen has posted videos of herself doing lovely renditions of Christian music on Instagram and TikTok.
