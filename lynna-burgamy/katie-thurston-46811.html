Furthermore, because her birthday was on January 3rd, we can deduce that her zodiac sign was Capricorn.</p><h2><span id=Katie_Thurston_Parents_Siblings_and_Neighborhood>Katie Thurston Parents, Siblings, and Neighborhood</span></h2><p>There was little information available about Katie’s parents or siblings. Katie Thurston revealed in an episode of The Bachelor that her father had died. In a conversation with fellow contestant Sarah Trott, she stated, “My father passed away in 2012, so I 100 percent encourage you to be with him.” If only I could relive the moments I spent with him… That is something I am becoming more aware of than I would like to be. Yes, knowing that changes everything. And I missed saying goodbye to my father, so I would never wish that on you.”</p><p>Katie was 21 years old when her father died, according to heavy.com.</p><p>Katie grew up in Renton, Washington, where she was still based.</p><h2><span id=Height_Weight_and_Distinctive_Characteristics>Height, Weight, and Distinctive Characteristics</span></h2><p><strong>Katie Thurston was a petite woman, standing at 5 feet 6 inches tall. She was also a very fit person, weighing only 54 kg.</strong></p><p>Katie had long wavy black/dark brown hair and light brown eyes, which were her distinguishing features.</p><h2><span id=Social_Media_Instagram_Facebook_and_Twitter><span class="TextRun SCXW36087002 BCX8" lang=en-us xml:lang=EN-US data-contrast=auto><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW36087002 BCX8" data-ccp-parastyle="heading 2">Social Media: Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter</span></span><span class="EOP SCXW36087002 BCX8" data-ccp-props='{"201341983":0,"335559738":40,"335559739":0,"335559740":259}'>&nbsp;</span></span></h2><p>Katie was a social media sensation on all platforms. By March 2021, she had 89 Instagram posts and a massive 535k following. She had 55k followers on Twitter.</p><p>Katie’s most visible presence, on the other hand, was on TikTok. She had over 277k followers and 1.4M likes on TikTok. Furthermore, she had gone viral on TikTok when she told a story about how he pooped at work.</p><p>Katie also had a YouTube channel with 530 subscribers, but no content was posted there.</p><h2><span id=Katie_Thurston8217s_Career_and_Education>Katie Thurston’s Career and Education</span></h2><p>Katie Thurston worked as a personal banking consultant for First Financial Northwest Bank’s Edmonds branch. She had been in the banking industry for over ten years [2021]. Aside from her work at the bank, she also volunteered for Snohomish County’s School Days school supply and backpack drive. She and her bank coworkers distributed school supplies to the students.</p><p>There was no information about Katie’s education at this point. We have no idea where she went to college. Katie, on the other hand, went to Lynnwood High School in Bothell, Washington. She was a member of the volleyball team at her school, serving as the libero.</p><p>Katie Thurston first came to public attention as a contestant on the 25th season of The Bachelor. 37 women competed for the attention of the Bachelor Matt James.</p><p>Matt James was the first black bachelor in the franchise. He was supposed to be a contestant on the final season of The Bachelorette, but after the season’s melodrama (read more here), he was chosen as The Bachelor’s lead.</p><p>Matt was originally from Raleigh, North Carolina, but was now based in New York. He was a real estate broker and the founder of a charity.</p><p>Katie made an excellent impression during her time on Matt’s The Bachelor. Because of her sense of humor and natural charm, she had an amazing rapport with Matt. She had also grown to be a fan favorite. At one point, she spoke out against bullying and defended a contestant (Sarah Trott) who had been ganged up on by other show contestants.</p><p>Katie, on the other hand, was unable to secure the season’s final birth and was eliminated just short of the final four after a one-on-one date with Matt. Rachael Kirkconnell, Michelle Young, Bri Springs, and Serena Pitt are Matt’s final four.</p><p>The rumors began when Bachelor Nation insider Stephen Carbon announced on Twitter that Katie Thurston had been named the next Bachelorette. Of course, everyone was overjoyed because Katie was a fan favorite. However, Katie later stated on Instagram that such information was also new to her, implying that she had no idea she would be the next Bachelorette. That meant there was no way of knowing who would be the next Bachelorette.</p><p>In the end, the rumors were true. During the March 2021 episode of The Bachelor: After The Final Rose, Emmanuel Acho announced Katie would be the lead in Season 17 of The Bachelorette. She referred to her season as the “Big Reset.”</p><h2><span id=What_is_the_Net_worth_of_Katie_Thurston><span class="TextRun SCXW193699041 BCX8" lang=en-us xml:lang=EN-US data-contrast=none><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW193699041 BCX8">What is the Net worth of Katie Thurston?</span></span><span class="EOP SCXW193699041 BCX8" data-ccp-props='{"201341983":0,"335559739":160,"335559740":259}'>&nbsp;</span></span></h2><p>According to some financial analysis sources, the average salary of a banker in the United States was $97,500, with additional bonuses averaging $16,500. That meant Katie would most likely earn around $103k per year. Furthermore, her net worth was estimated to be $750 thousand.</p><p><b><span data-contrast=auto>Katie Thurston estimated Net Worth</span></b><span data-contrast=auto>, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
