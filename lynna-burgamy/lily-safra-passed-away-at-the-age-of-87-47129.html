The wife of businessman Edmond Safra, Lily Safra, passed away in Geneva and will be buried on July 11.</h3><p>According to a spokesman for the Edmond J. Safra Foundation, she passed away after battling pancreatic cancer. Wolf White Watkins, a Czechoslovak railway engineer, and Annita Noudelman de Castro welcomed Lily Watkins into the world on December 30, 1934, in Porto Alegre, Brazil. Rio de Janeiro is where she was raised.</p><p>When Lily Safra was 17 years old, she wed Argentine hosiery tycoon Mario Cohen. The couple’s three children were named Claudio, Eduardo, and Adriana. They got divorced in the early 1960s.</p><p>In 1965, she remarried Alfredo “Freddy” Monteverde, owner of the Ponto Frio network of appliance stores in Brazil. Their only kid, Carlos, was adopted. After their 1969 wedding, Monteverde committed suicide four years later. According to historian Isabel Vincent, Lily’s late husband left her everything on his property.</p><p>Lily Watkins tied the knot with Edmond Safra for the fourth time in 1976. He founded the Republic National Bank in New York and was a well-known Brazilian banker.</p><p>The late banker’s family moved to Brazil following World War II. Along with his brothers Moise and Joseph, who also held banking authority, Edmond Safra was the owner of banks in New York and Europe.</p><p>The two split their time between France, New York, Geneva, and Monaco. According to the New York Post, they were both art collectors. Lily Safra reportedly paid $103.4 million for an Alberto Giacometti piece, according to reports.</p><p>In 1999, Edmond perished in a mysterious fire in Monaco that was ultimately determined to be an act of arson. The deceased banker “did not have his security remain the night while he slept in Monaco” because he felt so safe at home, according to sources. It was later determined that Ted Maher, his nurse, started the fire.</p><p>The defendant’s attorney, Michael Griffith, revealed that his client had started the fire, but only with Edmond’s permission.</p><p>“It was the stupidest, craziest thing a person could do. He had no desire to murder Mr. Safra. He merely desired that Mr. Safra value him more. His favorite was Mr. Safra. He had never had a better job than this one.</p><p>Sewage claims that Edmond Safra left his family and wife $800 million in addition to giving half of his assets to numerous charities. After Edmond’s passing, Lily Safra remained single.</p><p>Also Read: <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Wife, Girlfriend, And Family Of Adam G.
